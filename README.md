## Bumbl Car Seat Monitor iOS App

[Bumbl Baby Car Seat Monitor Product Page](http://www.bumblbaby.com/carsensor)

The Bumble Car Seat Monintor is an internet connected low energy proximity sensor.  It aims to tackle the problem of infants accidentally left in vehicles unattended.  The iOS app communicates over BLE with the monitor to detect the presence of a baby.  If an infant is left in his/her carseat, and a parent walks out of range of the vehicle, the app will alert the parent and provide an opportunity for the parent to acknowledge being alerted or notify emergency contacts of the location of the baby during the alert.
